displayed. High utilization values (>100%) mean the system is overloaded
(or the container has an invalid configuration).

.IP \fBPromised\fR 4
shows the resources soft limit values "promised" for a given container.
.IP \fBMax\ \fR 4
shows the resources hard limit values "promised" for a given container.
.P

.IP \fBMem+Swap\fR 4
